A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

This little project is a react app that simply displays a list of books fetched from a public api. By clicking a single book a page with details is shown.

## Built With

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup)

## Getting Started

### Installing

This is where you list how to get the project started. It typically just includes telling a person to clone the repo and then to install the dependencies e.g.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mortuus87/JS2CA.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running

NB! Note that the app expects to find an .env file that is not uploaded to the repo for security reasons, and may not work properly without it.

Navigate to the `app` folder.

To run the app, run the following commands:
```bash
npm start
```

Or if deploying:
```
npm run build
```
